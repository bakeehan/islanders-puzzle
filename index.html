<!-- Here's a problem. There are 12 men on an island. 11 weigh the exactly same amount, but one of them is slightly lighter or heavier. You must figure out which.
( And what do these men look like facially and with respect to their bodies?

The island has no scales, but there is a seesaw. The exciting catch: You can only use it three times.
( There is a prize for whoever solves it first.
Two tickets to this Sunday's Beyonce Knowles rock music concert. ) -->
